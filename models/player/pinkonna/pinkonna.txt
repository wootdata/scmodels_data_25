pinkonna is my quick/partial repaint of White Dragon's cool, anime-style "onna" model.

Just unzip into the players/pinkonna directory and have fun.

***Original Onna Model by White Dragon  2/28/99:

A brand new model of a cute anime style character.  I think this is
the first player model to have a resized biped <thus allowing the
shoulders to be in the right place> Hope you all enjoy it. I also
changed one death sequence just for fun! :)

I didn't add in team colors in this version. I hope to do it in my next model.

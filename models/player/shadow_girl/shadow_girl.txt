Skinner: Bamphalas
Skin Name: Shadow_Girl
Model Used: Dawn (Steve Gehrke)
Date 8/99

This is the number sixteen of my weekly skins available at my site.  http:\\i.am\bamphalas\
This skin was originally created for the TechWAR mod.  Now that we have a new model made, this one won't be used.  I decided to make it available to you.  She is a Ninja-style warrior fighting for survival on a war devastated earth.
Hope you like her!
